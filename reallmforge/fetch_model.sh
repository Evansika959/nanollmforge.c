# Download the bundled example model weights.
#
# The weights (~138 MB) are NOT stored in git: GitHub blocks files >100 MB and this public
# fork disallows Git LFS. Instead, upload smollm2_135M.q8.bin as a GitHub *Release* asset
# (Releases allow large files with no LFS) and point this script at it.
#
# Usage:
#   MODEL_URL="https://github.com/<you>/nanollm.c/releases/download/<tag>/smollm2_135M.q8.bin" \
#     reallmforge/fetch_model.sh
#   # or pass the URL as the first arg:
#   reallmforge/fetch_model.sh <URL>
#
# The tokenizer (tokenizer_gpt2.bin) IS committed in git (small), so you only need the weights.
